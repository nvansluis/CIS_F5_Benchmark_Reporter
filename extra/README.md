# Pie Chart
The HTML-report that is being generated by the CIS F5 Benchmark Reporter includes a pie chart diagram, which is a dynamic generated image. The IMG src in the HTML-report points to https://ipforward.nl/cis/piechart.php to load this image. This directory contains the piechart.php script that being used on this webserver.

If needed you can host this script on your own webserver. The script requires a PHP-enabled webserver that includes the GD and ImageMagick modules.
